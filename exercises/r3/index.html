            Laurel Schwulst thinks that websites should be a place to reflect individuality. The individuals are the
            "architects" of the websites. Websites are worlds to the creators/artists. Social Media does not allow full
            expression of the individual's creativity, it confines the imagination to standardized ways that was meant
            for generating profit for the big corporations. I agree with her to a certain extent, because people are
            optimizing their creativity to make "viral" posts that do not really show their individuality. However, I
            understand not everyone knows or has the interest in making their own websites, so Social Media simply fills
            the market gap for generating digital web content for the majority of nonprogrammers. 

            <br>
            <br>


            Schwulst uses the metaphor of Houses, rooms, worlds, architecture, plants, gardens, puddles, and rocks in an
            ocean.
            <br>
            <br>

            My metaphor for a website is a drop of water in the ocean. Each drop in the ocean consists of different
            compositions and matter. Some have more gold, heavy metals, zinc, organic matter, viruses, and bacteria.
            Just like a website, it could be simple, could be complex, a scam website, or a virus website.
            <br>
            <br>


            Depending on the location, the drop in the ocean might be warmer, colder, brighter, or darker. Normal
            websites and dark webs are like water in shallow water and deep sea water, some are more visible, and some
            are mysterious and hidden. Some websites are more popular than everyone uses, and some are hidden in the
            dark corners that nobody knows.
            <br>
            <br>


            Each drop of water in the ocean facilitates something else, it serves as a medium for fish and sea animals
            to breathe oxygen. Like a website, it has its function, it could work as a platform to promote one's works,
            a place to share ideas, and a medium to grow a community. However, ultimately, water holds everything in the
            ocean together including living organisms and matter. Just like the World Wide Web, all the websites are
            ultimately linked together like a drop of water in the ocean is connected to all the other drops of water.
            It facilitates the diversity of live forms in the "ocean".
            <br>
            <br>

            The quantity of drops of water in the ocean creates new systems, like circulations. Water currents generated
            by temperature differences are like trends online, for example, the crypto NFT metaverse trend. It creates
            momentum for a certain direction of water flow. Water also evaporates and consolidates or crystalizes into
            ice. This creates water cycles that nourish and make the ocean alive.  Website trends, designs, and
            functional websites change and evolve with hype cycles.
            <br>
            <br>



            Water has different forms, just like all matter. Water that is being consolidated into ice is like websites
            that never change but are visible to the public. It is also hard and difficult to change shape. Just like
            water from the North Pole, although rigid and hard to access, it stores the mass amount of historical
            information that is buried deep under ice. Websites that are like ice are hard-coded, not flexible, but it
            last a long time without maintenance. On the other hand, water that is evaporated is like highly evolving
            websites, they are quick to change, adaptable, and flexible. They might not last a long time but are
            certainly malleable and could morph into any shape. These websites could be prototype websites or MVP
            landing pages that change swiftly. .
