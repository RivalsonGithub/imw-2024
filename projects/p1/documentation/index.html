                    The central concept of my project revolves around creating an engaging scene that captures the essence of travel using various modes of transportation. This inspiration stems from multiple sources. Firstly, my frequent journeys to Markham involve navigating through multiple transit options, including subways, buses, GoTrains/GoBuses, and occasionally Viva. Secondly, the idea is reminiscent of my other travel experiences in Japan last summer, where I relied on JR trains, buses, and Shinkansen, often using all of them in a single day. Lastly, the visual inspiration draws from an Instagram reel featuring an anime edit of Jujutsu Kaisen, specifically a scene with Geto standing on a train, portrayed through dynamic jump cuts showcasing different moments in time (For example, first cut featuring a crowded train in the city; Next cut shows an empty train in the nature side). This is the reel (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CyA6beiAdnP/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CyA6beiAdnP/</a>)
