                    I build this poster for the seedfund pitch event for my game.
                    This event will take place in Feb 2024 (Exact date TBD).
                    I got inspiration in the fantasy style (thick lineart, anime manga artstyle. Simple and clean design. Gold lining aesthetics).
                    Since the assignment does not allow images, this affects some of the design choices. Such as using simple shapes for the background instead.
                    I used golden lines in the deisgn similar to the inspiration pictures I picked. The gold lines are references to the medieval aesthetics that resembles royality, legendary stories and fairytale.
                    I also drew layout inspirations from other gacha games such as Genshin Impact. They have a scroll up page that seperates the hero and the secondary topics.

                    The buttons have zoom in and color change effects. The middle title header "Project Princess" also have the zoom in effect (less strong), although it does not have a link associate to it.
                    I found 2 google fonts similar to the style that I am looking for that suits the aesthetics of the game (The titles fonts and paragraph fonts).

                    I used 3 spheres with different amount of blur and order to show depth, which looks like hills.
