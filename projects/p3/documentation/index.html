                    I took inspiration from my previous Reading 3 assignment and exapanded its functionalities to look better. It uses the same idea of my response website from Reading 3.
                    Each website links together to another website, like water drops touching each other constantly to form ocean.
                    Website trends and hype cycles are like ocean currents and the water cycle.
                    Websites that never change are like frozen ice, visible but rigid and difficult to modify, storing historical information.
                    Highly evolving websites are like evaporated water, quickly adapting and morphing like prototypes and landing pages.
                    The deeper the ocean, the darker it gets.
                    The quantity of drops, like websites, creates new systems and circulations, akin to trends and directions in the digital space. 
                    One drop of water is not the ocean, but drops and drops of water together.

                    Here, instead of using basic hover to expand seperated spans in a paragraph. I seperated every word and locate them into their own table cells. 
                    In this case, whenever the user hovers on the cell, it will activate the Hover class on itself and it's neighbouring cells. 
                    The one that is being hovered directly has a stronger color and opacity.
                    The change of size and color simulates water tension and water pressure. Each words seamless blends into another word.

                    Users here can also click onto the texts, and the texts will be highlighted / frozen in black. 
                    The user can creatively string interesting phrases together by locking the right combination of words.
